# Excel Quote Generator

This project contains an automated Excel tool developed with VBA macros to generate individual quote files based on a list of policies.  
It streamlines the process by executing calculations, populating a predefined proposal template, and saving each result as a separate Excel file.

## Features
- Processes a list of policies automatically.
- Executes calculation macros for subgroups, rates, and adjustments.
- Populates the "Proposal for Renewal" sheet with the corresponding policy data.
- Generates and saves a new Excel file for each policy.
- Supports protected workbooks and avoids leaving open files after execution.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel (with macros enabled).
- Access to the original quote file and template.
- External quinquennium file (optional, for additional calculations).
